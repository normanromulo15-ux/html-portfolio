<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>Hi everyone! I am Norman Digma G. Romulo, a 23-year old who is currently learning and diving the world of web development!
  I have a college degree in electrical engineering, however, after knowing myself better, I decided to shift paths as I believe this 
  field aligns with my natural aptitude and strength as a detail-oriented and introverted person.
</p>
<p> I am enthusiastic to share my personal projects and progress throughout my learning journey in my portfolio. Let's go!
